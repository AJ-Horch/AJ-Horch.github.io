### Forecasting NYC rat sightings

Employed SARIMA to forecast rat sightings across NYC neighbourhoods. Identified what neighbourhoods should expect more sightings, resulting in actionable public policy 
considerations to reduce sightings.

### Spatial temporal analysis of bike sharing

Spatial temporal visualizations were analyzed to discover how commuters use Chicagoâ€™s public bike-sharing scheme. 
Actionable insights include sites for new bike stations and bike redistribution.

### Spotify playlist recommendation models:

Scraped personal and public Spotify playlists to assess 8 machine learning 
supervised algorithms. These algorithms were used to create new playlists. The features were scaled when 
necessary and hyperparameters were tuned to get the best results

### MLP & SVM optimization for Classification
This project intends to present a critical and even-handed evaluation of two algorithms' performance in a supervised classification task on Cardiotocography records from fetuses. The two algorithms compared are Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Machine Vector(SVM). Multiply experiments were conducted on each model, with differing hyperparameters in a grid search. The test of the top models were evaluated and compared using confusion matrices and Receiver Operation Curves. This project required using PyTorch and Sci-Key Learn.

### SQL for data job market
Focusing on data analyst and scientist roles, this project explores top-paying jobs, in-demand skills and where high demand meets high salary in data analytics.

#### These are the questions I answered
- What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
- Where are jobs being posted in the UK
- What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
- What skills are most in-demand for data analysts?
- Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
- What are the most optimal skills to learn
