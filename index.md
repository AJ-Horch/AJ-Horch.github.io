### Forecasting NYC rat sightings

Employed SARIMA to forecast rat sightings across NYC neighbourhoods. Identified what neighbourhoods should expect more sightings, resulting in actionable public policy 
considerations to reduce sightings.

### Spatial temporal analysis of bike sharing

Spatial temporal visualizations were analyzed to discover how commuters use Chicagoâ€™s public bike-sharing scheme. 
Actionable insights include sites for new bike stations and bike redistribution.

### MLP & SVM optimization for Classification
This project intends to present a critical and even-handed evaluation of two algorithms' performance in a supervised classification task on Cardiotocography records from fetuses. The two algorithms compared are Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Machine Vector(SVM). Multiply experiments were conducted on each model, with differing hyperparameters in a grid search. The test of the top models were evaluated and compared using confusion matrices and Receiver Operation Curves. This project required using PyTorch and Sci-Key Learn.
